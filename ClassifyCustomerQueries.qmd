## Classifying Customer Queries Into Categories

For this notebook we would like to set up classifying customer queries into a
primary category and a secondary category. This might be the first step in
routing the customer in a customer support application.

### Primary and Secondary Category

Here are our primary and secondary categories:

- Billing
  - Unsubscribe or upgrade
  - Add a payment method
  - Explanation for charge
  - Dispute a charge
- Technical Support
  - General troubleshooting
  - Device compatibility
  - Software updates
- Account Management
  - Password reset
  - Update personal information
  - Close account
  - Account security
- General Inquiry
  - Product information
  - Pricing
  - Feedback
  - Speak to a human

### Example Queries

And here are some examples of the kinds of queries we will classify:

| Query |
| --- |
| I want you to delete my profile and all of my user data |
| Tell me more about your flat screen tvs |
| How do I update my email address and password on my account? |
| I need help setting up parental controls on my streaming account. |
| How do I change the primary account holder for my subscription? |

- set up a prompt that accomplishes classifying the above into a primary and secondary category.
- tell the LLM what format to put the answer in
- the {query} template variable is already included and enclosed in tags.

```{python}
template = """

<<PUT YOUR PROMPT TEMPLATE HERE. LEAVE QUERY PART BELOW AS IS>>

<query>
{query}
</query>
"""
```
```{python}
# __SOLUTION__ 
template ="""
You will be provided with a customer service query in <query></query> tags
below.

Classify each query into a primary category and a secondary category.

Provide your output like this:

Primary Category: <<primary_category>>
Secondary Category: <<secondary_category>>

Primary categories: Billing, Technical Support, Account Management, or General
Inquiry.

The secondary category must come from the lists below.

Billing secondary categories:
- Unsubscribe or upgrade
- Add a payment method
- Explanation for charge
- Dispute a charge

Technical Support secondary categories:
- General troubleshooting
- Device compatibility
- Software updates

Account Management secondary categories:
- Password reset
- Update personal information
- Close account
- Account security

General Inquiry secondary categories:
- Product information
- Pricing
- Feedback
- Speak to a human

<query>
{query}
</query>"""
```

### I want you to delete my profile and all of my user data

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
I want you to delete my profile and all of my user data
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Tell me more about your flat screen tvs

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
Tell me more about your flat screen tvs
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### I can't log into my account. Can you reset my password?

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
I can't log into my account. Can you reset my password?
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### I'm having trouble connecting my smart TV to the internet. Can you help me troubleshoot this issue?

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
I'm having trouble connecting my smart TV to the internet. Can you help me troubleshoot this issue?
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### I'd like to cancel my subscription and get a refund for the remaining months.

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
fifth_query = """
I'd like to cancel my subscription and get a refund for the remaining months.
"""

prompt=template.format(query=fifth_query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### How do I update my email address and password on my account?

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
How do I update my email address and password on my account?
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### What are the key features of your premium streaming package compared to the basic plan?

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
seventh_query = """
What are the key features of your premium streaming package compared to the basic plan?
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

```

### I have some feedback about improving the user interface of your mobile app.

Set up the query string and send to the llm:

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
query = """
I have some feedback about improving the user interface of your mobile app.
"""

prompt=template.format(query=query)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Additional Queries

Its pretty easy to set up a loop to evaluate a lot of these for testing.

```{python}
# __REGULAR_BLOCK__ 
additional_queries = [
    "I need help setting up parental controls on my streaming account.",
    "How do I change the primary account holder for my subscription?",
    "I was overcharged on my last bill. Can you investigate this issue?",
    "Is there a way to download movies and shows for offline viewing?",
    "Can you recommend some good shows or movies based on my viewing history?",
    "My streaming quality keeps buffering. What could be causing this?",
    "I want to add another user to my account. How can I do that?",
    "How do I update my payment method with a new credit card?",
    "I'm having issues with the audio on certain shows. Can you help me troubleshoot?",
    "What's the process for reporting a technical issue with your platform?"
]


for query in additional_queries:
    prompt = template.format(query=query)
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(response)
    print("---")
```
