I have some customers with their purchase histories at H&M over the past 6 months
listed below. Can you classify each customer into one of the three profiles
based on their purchases?

{customers_info}

For each customer, specify which of the 5 profiles you would assign them to
and your reasoning based on the items purchased.

Also print out the customers purchases and total spent.
Give the output like this for each customer:

Purchases: <<list the purchases>>
Total Spent: <<total spent>>

Reasons: <<reasons>>

When you are finished with all the customers print out these totals:
Trendy Fashionista: <<number of these>>
