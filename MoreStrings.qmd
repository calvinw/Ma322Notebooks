## Defining Strings

Define a string variable called `aString` by using the string `Hello Cruel World` by using single quotes for the string. Print it.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```
```{python}
# Solution:
aString = 'Hello Cruel World'
print(aString)
```

Define a string variable called `aString` by using the string `Goodbye Cruel World` by using double quotes for the string. Print it.


```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```
```{python}
# Solution:
aString = "Hello Cruel World"
print(aString)
```

Define a multiline string variable called `aString` using `See you later alligator`

using triple quotes and put each word on a separate line like this:

```
See
you
later
alligator
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```
```{python}
# Solution:
aString = """
See
you
later
alligator
"""
print(aString)
```

## Accessing Parts of a String (Indexing)


Define a string variable called `aString` to be `"Python"`. and print the first character using index notation.

```{python}
#| eval: false
 CODE
```
```{python}
# Solution:
aString = "Python"
print(aString[0])
```

Define a string variable called `aString` to be `"Programming"`, and print the last three characters.

```{python}
#| eval: false
 CODE
```
```{python}
# Solution:
aString = "Ma322 is the most fun, it is just unbelievable!"
print(aString[-3:])
```

## Concatenating Strings

Concatenate two strings, `"Welcome "` and `"to Ma322!"`, and print the result.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```

## Replicating Strings

Create a string that repeats `"Coding "` three times and print it.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```

## String Methods

Given the string `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`, replace `"lazy dog"` with `"energetic puppy"` using the `replace()` method and print the new string.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```

Given the string `"book,pen,paper,notebook"`, split it into a list of substrings using the `split()` method and print the list.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```

Given the list `['Python', 'is', 'awesome']`, join the elements into a single string using the `join()` method with `'xoxoxo'` as the separator, and print the resulting string.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```

## Length of a String

Given the string `"Learn Python today!"`, print its length using the `len()` function.

```{python}
#| eval: false
CODE
```
