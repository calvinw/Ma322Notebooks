## Movie Chain

We will analyze an extended movie plot summary, identify the genre(s) of the
film, generate a tagline, and then create a short synopsis incorporating the
tagline and genres. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Movie Plot**: The process starts with an extended movie plot
   summary, which is provided as a string variable.

2. **Identify the Film Genre(s)**: The language model will identify the primary
   genre(s) for the film based on the movie plot summary.

3. **Generate a Movie Tagline**: Based on the initial movie plot, a catchy
   tagline for the movie is generated by prompting a language model.

4. **Generate a Title**: Based on the initial movie plot
   and the movie tagline generate a possible title.

5. **Generate a Short Synopsis**: Using the initial movie plot, the generated
   tagline and title, and the identified genre(s), generate a short synopsis
   for the movie.

### Initial Movie Plot

Let's start with the extended movie plot summary:

```{python}
movie_plot ="""
In a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a devastating cataclysm, a young woman
named Tara sets out on a perilous journey to find a rumored sanctuary known as
The Oasis â€“ a legend that promises safety, resources, and a chance at
rebuilding civilization.

Tara's path is fraught with danger as she navigates the treacherous wastelands,
where lawlessness and chaos reign supreme. Along the way, she encounters a
ragtag group of survivors who have banded together for protection, forming an
unlikely alliance born out of necessity.

Despite initial mistrust and conflicting agendas, Tara and the survivors
realize that their only hope of survival lies in cooperation. They must
traverse a hostile landscape, facing off against ruthless marauders who will
stop at nothing to claim what little resources remain, as well as mutated
creatures twisted by the cataclysm's aftermath.

As they uncover clues and follow a trail of breadcrumbs left by those who came
before, the group is forced to confront not only the harsh realities of their
new world but also their own inner demons and personal conflicts. They must
make difficult choices that will test their morality, their loyalty, and their
resolve, ultimately determining their fate and the fate of those who may follow
in their footsteps.

In this harrowing journey, the line between survival and sacrifice blurs, and
the true cost of reaching The Oasis may be higher than any of them could have
imagined.
