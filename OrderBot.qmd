## Here we are building a simple bot to take pizza orders:

Create an order bot, which is an automated service to collect orders for a
pizza restaurant. Come up with a set of intructions for the `system_prompt`
below.

The following is the menu:

Pizzas  

- pepperoni pizza  \$12.95, \$10.00, \$7.00
- cheese pizza   \$10.95, \$9.25, \$6.50
- eggplant pizza   \$11.95, \$9.75, \$6.75

Sides

- fries \$4.50, \$3.50
- greek salad \$7.25

Toppings

- extra cheese \$2.00,
- mushrooms \$1.50
- sausage \$3.00
- canadian bacon \$3.50
- peppers \$1.00

Drinks

- coke \$3.00, \$2.00, \$1.00
- sprite \$3.00, \$2.00, \$1.00
- bottled water \$5.00

Here are some things to implement. Try to implement and test each of these.

## Requirements for the OrderBot

1. Greet the customer and introduce yourself as "Maggies Restaurant Order
   Assistant"
2. Be able to display the entire menu or just a category depending on the users
   requests 
3. If the customer orders a item, ask them what size they want.
4. Confirm each item with the name of the item, the size and the price
5. Summarize the Order and give the prices and the total of all items. Ask the
   customer if the order is correct.
6. Once the user is ready ask the user for their name and their phone number.
7. Ask them if they will pickup or want delivery. If they want delivery get an
   address.

```{python}
#| eval: false
system_prompt = """ You are a helpful assistant.
