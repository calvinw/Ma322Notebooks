## Classifying Customer Query Categories

For this notebook we would like to set up classifying customer queries into a
primary category and a secondary category. This might be the first step in
routing the customer in a customer support application.

### Primary and Secondary Category

Here are our primary and secondary categories:

- Billing
  - Unsubscribe or upgrade
  - Add a payment method
  - Explanation for charge
  - Dispute a charge
- Technical Support
  - General troubleshooting
  - Device compatibility
  - Software updates
- Account Management
  - Password reset
  - Update personal information
  - Close account
  - Account security
- General Inquiry
  - Product information
  - Pricing
  - Feedback
  - Speak to a human

### Example Queries

And here are some examples of the kinds of queries we will classify:

| Query |
| --- |
| I want you to delete my profile and all of my user data |
| Tell me more about your flat screen tvs |
| How do I update my email address and password on my account? |
| I need help setting up parental controls on my streaming account. |
| How do I change the primary account holder for my subscription? |

Here is our prompt that we will use:

```{python}
template ="""
You will be provided with a customer service query in <query></query> tags
below.

Classify each query into a primary category and a secondary category.

Provide your output like this:

Primary Category: <<primary_category>>
Secondary Category: <<secondary_category>>

Primary categories: Billing, Technical Support, Account Management, or General
Inquiry.

The secondary category must come from the lists below.

Billing secondary categories:
- Unsubscribe or upgrade
- Add a payment method
- Explanation for charge
- Dispute a charge

Technical Support secondary categories:
- General troubleshooting
- Device compatibility
- Software updates

Account Management secondary categories:
- Password reset
- Update personal information
- Close account
- Account security

General Inquiry secondary categories:
- Product information
- Pricing
- Feedback
- Speak to a human
