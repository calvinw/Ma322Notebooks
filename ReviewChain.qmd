### Description of Review Chain

We will analyze a customer review and summarize it. Then try to compose a response.

Here are the steps in the analysis:

1. **Initial Review**: The process starts with a customer review, which is
  provided as a string variable.

1. **Analyze the sentiment of the original review on a scale of 1 to 5**: The
  sentiment of the original review is analyzed on a scale of 1 (very negative)
  to 5 (very positive) by prompting a language model.

1. **Categorize the Review Based On the Main Issue**: The main issue or concern
  raised in the review is categorized into one of the following categories:
  Product Quality, Shipping/Delivery, Customer Service, Pricing, or Other.

1. **Suggest Potential Improvements Based On the Review**: At least three
  potential improvements or changes are suggested to address the customer's
  concerns based on the review.

1. **Write an individualized email response to the customer**: A polite and
  professional email response is drafted, addressing the customer's concerns
  and offering a resolution or next steps.
