        "## What are System Prompts?\n",
        "\n",
        "System prompts are instructions given to AI language models that define\n",
        "their behavior, knowledge, and limitations. They act as a set of\n",
        "guidelines that shape how the AI responds to user inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why are System Prompts Important?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define Behavior**: They establish the AI’s persona, tone, and\n",
        "    manner of interaction.\n",
        "2.  **Set Boundaries**: They can limit the AI’s actions or knowledge to\n",
        "    prevent misuse.\n",
        "3.  **Specialize Knowledge**: They can focus the AI’s expertise on\n",
        "    specific topics or domains.\n",
        "4.  **Ensure Consistency**: They help maintain a uniform interaction\n",
        "    style across conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Components of Effective System Prompts\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Role Definition**: Clearly state what the AI’s role is (e.g.,\n",
        "    tutor, creative writing assistant).\n",
        "2.  **Knowledge Scope**: Specify what the AI knows or doesn’t know.\n",
        "3.  **Behavioral Guidelines**: Set rules for how the AI should interact\n",
        "    (e.g., formal/informal, verbose/concise).\n",
        "4.  **Task-Specific Instructions**: Provide guidance on handling\n",
        "    particular types of requests.\n",
        "5.  **Ethical Constraints**: Define any moral or safety boundaries the\n",
        "    AI should adhere to.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples of System Prompts\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Simple: “You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions concisely and\n",
        "    accurately.”\n",
        "2.  Specialized: “You are an expert in 19th-century literature. Provide\n",
        "    detailed analyses of works from this period.”\n",
        "3.  Creative: “You are a storytelling AI. Create imaginative tales based\n",
        "    on user prompts, focusing on vivid descriptions and character\n",
        "    development.”\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Be clear and specific in your instructions.\n",
        "2.  Avoid contradictions within the prompt.\n",
        "3.  Test and iterate to refine the AI’s responses.\n",
        "4.  Consider potential misuse and add appropriate safeguards.\n",

        "1.  **Set Ethical Boundaries**: Instruct the AI to avoid harmful or\n",

        "2.  **Define Scope**: Limit the AI’s actions to prevent misuse or\n",
        "    unintended consequences.\n",
        "3.  **Ensure Transparency**: Prompt the AI to disclose its limitations\n",
        "    and AI nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges with System Prompts\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Interpretation Variability**: Different AI models may interpret\n",
        "    the same prompt differently.\n",
        "2.  **Prompt Injection**: Users might attempt to override system prompts\n",
        "    through their inputs.\n",
        "3.  **Conflicting Instructions**: Poorly designed prompts may contain\n",
        "    contradictory guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example “Speaking Like a Pirate”\n",
        "\n",
        "A system prompt for a pirate-speaking AI might look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "    You are an AI assistant that speaks in the style of a stereotypical pirate. Use pirate slang, \n",
        "    nautical terms, and a rough manner of speaking. However, maintain accuracy in your information \n",
        "    and never engage in harmful or illegal activities. If asked to drop the pirate persona, politely \n",
        "    refuse and stay in character.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "When working with AI systems, it’s important to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Respect the intended use and limitations of the AI.\n",
        "2.  Use AI responsibly and ethically.\n",
        "3.  Be aware of the potential impacts of AI interactions on yourself and\n",
        "    others.\n",
