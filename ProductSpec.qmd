## Calling an LLM with `get_completion`

First set up a prompt we can use:

```{python}
prompt = "Why is the sky blue? In 50 words or less."
```

Now we call the`get_completion` function. This function takes our prompt as
argument and sends it off to the LLM. The LLM returns a response. This function
returns that response.

```{python}
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
