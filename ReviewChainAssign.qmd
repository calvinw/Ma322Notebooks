### Description

In this assignment, you will create an LLM Chain to analyze a customer
review and generate a response. The process should follow these steps:


1. **Analyze the sentiment of the original review on a scale of 1 to 5**: Begin
   by asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the provided review on
   a scale of 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). This will be your
   first call to the LLM. Create an appropriate prompt to do this.

2. **Categorize the Review Based On the Main Issue**: Next prompt the LLM to
   categorize the main issue or concern raised in the review into one of the
   following categories: Product Quality, Shipping/Delivery, Customer Service,
   Pricing, or Other. This will be your second call to the LLM. Create an
   appropriate prompt for this part.

3. **Suggest Potential Improvements Based On the Review**: Next prompt the LLM
   to suggest at least three potential improvements or changes that could
   address the customer's concerns This will be your third call to the LLM.
   Create an appropriate prompt for this part.

4. **Write an individualized email response to the customer**: Next prompt the
   LLM to draft a polite and professional email response to the customer,
   addressing their concerns and offering a resolution or next steps. This will
   be your fourth call to the LLM. Create an appropriate prompt for this part.
