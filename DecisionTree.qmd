Sure, here's the Quarto file using Python instead of R:

```yaml
---
title: "Decision Trees"
jupyter: python3
---

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read data from URL
url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTFmRX4RW3PitgcJya0X2sRbSiD0J2t0oYewyhkkyWwR9i8NIaHiuQKrBtLlrwG9fzn4MvNOM92olnK/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Building a Decision Tree

```{python}
# Print the data
print(df)
```

Let's sort it by gender:

```{python}
print(df.sort_values('gender'))
```

So, if we split on gender, here's what we would get:

```{python}
# Create a decision tree classifier and fit it to the data
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
clf = clf.fit(df[['gender']], df['product'])

# Visualize the decision tree
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['gender'], class_names=['product'], filled=True)
plt.show()
```

Let's sort it by age:

```{python}
print(df.sort_values('age'))
```

```{python}
# Create a decision tree classifier and fit it to the data
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
clf = clf.fit(df[['age']], df['product'])

# Visualize the decision tree
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['age'], class_names=['product'], filled=True)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Create a decision tree classifier and fit it to the data
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
clf = clf.fit(df[['age', 'gender']], df['product'])

# Visualize the decision tree
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['age', 'gender'], class_names=['product'], filled=True)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# pred = clf.predict(testdf)
# print(pred)
```

Note that in this Python version, I've used the scikit-learn library for building and visualizing the decision trees. The `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` class is used to create the decision tree classifier, and the `tree.plot_tree` function is used to visualize the decision tree.

Also, note that the last code block for making predictions on a test dataset is commented out, as we don't have a `testdf` defined in this example.
