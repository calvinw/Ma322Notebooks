## Calling an LLM without delimiters

First set up a prompt we can use:

```{python}
template ='''
Below is a list of sentences. Tell me the second item on the list.
- Each is about an animal, like rabbits.
{sentences}
'''

my_sentences='''- I like how cows sound
- This sentence is about spiders
- This sentence may appear to be about dogs but it's actually about pigs'''

prompt = template.format(sentences=my_sentences)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```

Now lets use delimiters:

```{python}
template ="""
Below is a list of sentences that appears inside <sentences> and </sentences> tags.

Tell me the second item on the list.

- Each is about an animal, like rabbits.
<sentences>
{sentences}
</sentences>
"""

my_sentences='''- I like how cows sound
- This sentence is about spiders
- This sentence may appear to be about dogs but it's actually about pigs'''

prompt = template.format(sentences=my_sentences)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```
