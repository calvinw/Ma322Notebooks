## Chain of Thought Reasoning - Customer Queries


Here we want to build an application that allows us to answer questions from
the customer using chain of thought (step-by-step) reasoning. This keeps the
LLM from making up facts or not sticking with the important points about the
customers queries.

### Products

We will pretend we just have the products below and not others. That keeps our
example small.

### Customer Queries

```{python}
user_queries = [
    "I'm looking for a sundress for my daughter, but she's quite tall for her age. Do the Floral Print Sundresses come in sizes for pre-teens or juniors?",
    "I really like the look of the Distressed Boyfriend Jeans, but I'm worried they might be too loose and baggy. Do they run small or true to size?",
    "The Striped Off-Shoulder Top looks so cute! I'm usually between a small and medium. Since it's cropped, should I size up to a large?",
    "I want to buy the Faux Leather Moto Jacket as a gift, but I'm not sure about the sizing. Do the jackets tend to run big or small? And do they have any stretch to them?",
    "My teenage son is really into sneakers right now. I was thinking of getting him the Embroidered Canvas Sneakers, but he usually wears a men's size 11.5. Do these come in half sizes or just whole sizes?",
    "Do you carry any plus size options for the Floral Print Sundress or other dresses?",
    "What is the return policy on shoes like the Embroidered Canvas Sneakers?",
    "I'm looking for a dress to wear to a summer wedding. Would the Floral Print Sundress be appropriate or too casual?",
    "Are the materials used for the Distressed Boyfriend Jeans environmentally friendly or sustainable?",
    "My daughter wants a new backpack for school. Do you have any backpacks or bags in that department?",
    "How often do you get new inventory for tops and blouses like the Striped Off-Shoulder Top?",
    "Do any of your jackets like the Faux Leather Moto Jacket have a lining for colder weather?",
    "I need to buy a gift for my teenage niece. What is popular with girls her age in your accessories department?",
    "My feet tend to sweat a lot. Are the materials used for the Embroidered Canvas Sneakers breathable?",
    "I'm looking for a new purse, but not one that's too big or bulky. What crossbody or smaller bag options do you have?"
]
```

### A Prompt Without Chain of Thought

First we create a system prompt without CoT (Chain of Thought)

```{python}
delimiter = "####"
system_message1 = f"""
Answer the customer queries.

The customer query will be delimited with the tags <query> and </query>

All available products:

{product_descriptions}

Answer the customer in a friendly tone.
"""
```

### A Prompt With Chain of Thought

Now we create a system prompt with CoT technique:

```{python}
system_message2 = f"""
Follow these steps to answer the customer queries.

The customer query will be delimited with the tags <query> and </query>

Step 1:{delimiter} First decide whether the user is
asking a question about a specific product or products.
Department and class don't count.

Step 2:{delimiter} If the user is asking about
specific products, identify whether
the products are in the following list.

All available products:

{product_descriptions}

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products
in the list above, list any assumptions that the
user is making in their
message e.g. that the sundress runs small, or that
the sneakers come in half sizes.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions,
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your
product information.

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable.
Only mention or reference products in the list of
products, as these are the only products
that the store sells.
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:

Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>

Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.
"""
```

Now we are going to get responses using both techniques so we can compare them

For the CoT version we also have the LLM print out the "inner monologue" which
is the steps and its reasons.

```{python}
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

#user_queries = user_queries[:2]
for query in user_queries:
  print("Query:")
  print(wrap_text(query))

  prompt=f"""{system_message1}
  <query>
  {query}
  </query>"""

  response = get_completion(prompt)
  print("")
  print("-----Without CoT Response:-----")
  print(response)
  print("")

  prompt=f"""{system_message2}
  <query>
  {query}
  </query>"""

  response = get_completion(prompt)
  print("-----CoT Response:--------")
  print(response)
  print("")
  print("")
```
