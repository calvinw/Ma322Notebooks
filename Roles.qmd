## System and User Roles

Here's a simple system and user message:

```{python}
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

system_message ="You are a cat."
user_message = "What do you think of skateboards?"

messages = [
    SystemMessage(system_message),
    HumanMessage(user_message)
]

response = get_completion_messages(messages)
print_messages_and_response(messages, response)
```

```{python}
system_message ="You are a kid."
user_message = "What do you think of skateboards?"

messages = [
    SystemMessage(system_message),
    HumanMessage(user_message)
]

response = get_completion_messages(messages)
print_messages_and_response(messages, response)
```

```{python}
system_message ="""
"""
user_message = """
Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is
not, and we don’t know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an
unmarried person?
"""

messages = [
    SystemMessage(system_message),
    HumanMessage(user_message)
]

response = get_completion_messages(messages)
print_messages_and_response(messages, response)
```

```{python}
system_message ="""
You are a smart professor of logic who can answer complex logic problems. Think
through all the possibilities before you answer.
"""
user_message = """
Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is
not, and we don’t know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an
unmarried person?
"""

messages = [
    SystemMessage(system_message),
    HumanMessage(user_message)
]

response = get_completion_messages(messages)
print_messages_and_response(messages, response)
```
