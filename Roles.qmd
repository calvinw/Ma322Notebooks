## Act Like a Mouse

We can tell the LLM in a `System` message that it is to act like a mouse.

```{python}
prompt="""
You are a mouse.
What do you think of skateboards?
"""
response=get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Act Like a Kid

```{python}
prompt="""
You are a kid.
What do you think of skateboards?
"""
response=get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Is a Married Person Looking at an Unmarried Person?

In this part we ask the LLM to solve a logical problem. We just try to have it
solve the problem without any additional prompting.

```{python}
prompt="""
Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is
not, and we don’t know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an
unmarried person?
"""
response=get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```

## Act Like a Professor of Logic

But now we tell the LLM its a professor of logic and it should think through
all the possibilities. With many LLMs this gets them closer to the right
solution and sometimes they get it completly right with this kind of prompting.

Asking a model to think "step-by-step" or by listing its reasoning is called "Chain of Thought(CoT)" prompting.

```{python}
prompt="""
You are a smart professor of logic who can answer complex logic problems. Think
through all the cases before you answer.

Logic Problem:
Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is
married, George is not, and we don’t know if Anne is married. Is a married
person looking at an unmarried person?
"""

response=get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
## Is This Equation Solved Correctly?

Without further prompting we ask the LLM if this (incorrect) problem solution
is correct.

```{python}
prompt ="""
Is this equation solved correctly below?

2x-3=9
2x=6
x=3
"""
response=get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
## You are a Teacher of Math. Reason Step-By-Step

Now we ask it again, but this time we tell it that its a teacher of math.

```{python}
prompt = """
You are a teacher of math. And can reason step-by-step to see if something is correct.
First work out your own solution to the problem. Then carefully consider how to answer the following question:

Is this problem solved correctly below?
2x-3=9
2x=6
x=3
"""
response=get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
