Here is an example of a simple chain with 2 calls to an LLM. The first call asks for 3 names of a company, then the second call asks the LLM to take the response from the first call and upper case it.

This represents a chain of calls to LLMs and we want to show how to do this with F-strings.

Its easy if we dont care about re-using the the chain. Here is how to achieve it with a couple of FStrings.

Run the version below which is created with 2 F-strings. Each one is the prompt that will be passed to the LLM for that stage of the chain.

```{python}
#| eval: true
thing = "toothpicks"

first_query = f"""
Give me 3 possible names for companies that make {thing}.
Just list the 3 names like this:
1 <Company 1 name>
2 <Company 2 name>
3 <Company 3 name>
"""

first_response = get_completion(first_query)
print(first_response)

second_query = f"""
Can you upper case the text below:
Just uppercase the text and return the uppercased version.

{first_response}

"""
second_response = get_completion(second_query)
print(second_response)
```

```{python}
#| eval: true
def chain(thing):
  first_query = f"""
  Give me 3 possible names for companies that make {thing}.
  Just list the 3 names like this:
  1 <Company 1 name>
  2 <Company 2 name>
  3 <Company 3 name>
  """

  first_response = get_completion(first_query)
  print(first_response)
  print(80*'-')

  second_query = f"""
  Can you upper case the text below:
  Just uppercase the text and return the uppercased version.

  {first_response}

  """

  second_response = get_completion(second_query)
  return second_response

response=chain("bikes")
print(response)

print(80*"*")

response=chain("firecrackers")
print(response)

print(80*"*")

response=chain("yoga mats")
print(response)
```
