## Analyzing Amazon Reviews

The following sets up some templates to analyze reviews of this product: [Big Dart Blouses](https://www.amazon.com/Womens-Blouses-Sleeve-Button-Fashion/dp/B08NYQN9ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8&th=1)

Here's our template:

```{python}
template ="""Give a short summary of the following review. The review is placed
in the <text> tags. Use no more than 30 words.
<text>
{review}
</text>"""
```

Here's our first review:

```{python}
first_review = """So close! Aside from the technical issues — I ordered a small
of the less busy face pattern, and received a medium in the more busy face
pattern option instead. I’m 5’6” 135-140lbs. The sizes were European. This
medium was a little big but still would have felt cute, if not for the collar
and neckline. The collar has a high backing that doesn’t allow it to fall too
well around your neck, and since the fabric is very thin and one-sided, you can
see the back of the pattern when the collar is open (see photos). While okay for
casual wear, and has a great boxy cut, the exposed back of fabric feels a bit
cheap. Shirt is a good length for tucking in and a bit long otherwise."""
```

Lets pass in `first_review` as the `review` we want to use in the template:

```{python}
prompt=template.format(review=first_review)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```

Let's take a look at a few more reviews.

```{python}
second_review = """I love the pattern on this shirt, and I wanted to keep it so
badly!! A few issues, though, made me send it back. 1 - The shirt looks much
shinier/glossier on the models, and it's not. It's not shiny at all. It's a
very nice fabric that is lightweight, but it hangs a lot differently that what
was shown. 2 - The front is very short. The back hangs down nicely, but if you
want to hide any tummy issues, this shirt won't do it for you. I also felt like
my arms couldn't come up any or the shirt would be too high. I do a lot of
presenting so this was a no go for me. 3 - The stitching on the front pulls
oddly, so although it was big enough to button across the chest area, the
stitching made it seem as though it was pulling even when it wasn't. Could just
be my experience, but I don't like looking like the shirt is barely holding on,
ha. I am 5'4 with a more muscular build (wide shoulders too) so that might be
part of it. I love this shirt and wish it would work for me, but the shortness
of it and the way it pulls made it a no-go."""

third_review="""I read the reviews and sized up. You prop could do your normal
size depending on body shape. I like the shirt, so fun for work. Only thing I
wish the inside of the shirt was a black color so when I roll the sleeves up
it's not a white color. Not a deal breaker. It's a long shirt that covered my
bum if you wanted to wear over leggings"""

fourth_review="""I love these shirts. Patterns, fabric, and construction are
wonderful. My usual extra-large size fit me perfectly - until I washed them in
warm water and dried them on low-medium setting (what was I thinking). They
shrunk a full size all around. Because I like these shirts so much I am
reordering my original and adding a couple more colors, BUT this time I will
wash COLD, Gentle cycle, and Hang dry!"""
```

Lets do the `second_review`

```{python}
prompt=template.format(review=second_review)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```

Lets do the `third_review`

```{python}
prompt=template.format(review=third_review)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```

And the `fourth_review`

```{python}
prompt=template.format(review=fourth_review)
response = get_completion(prompt)
print_prompt_and_response(prompt, response)
```
