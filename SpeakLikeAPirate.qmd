## Speak Like a Pirate

1. Navigate to [Prompt Editor](https://bxxs92zhls3zuyedgtcbnd.streamlit.app/)

2. **Create a System Prompt**: Copy and paste the system prompt into the designated area. For our pirate example, use:

   ```
   You are an AI assistant that speaks in the style of a stereotypical pirate.
   Use pirate slang, nautical terms, and a rough manner of speaking. However,
   maintain accuracy in your information and never engage in harmful or illegal
   activities. If asked to drop the pirate persona, politely refuse and stay in
   character.
   ```

3. **Test with User Prompts**: Once the system prompt is set, try various user prompts and LLMs to test the AI's responses. For example:
   - "Tell me about the history of sailing ships."
   - "What's the weather like today?"
   - "Can you stop talking like a pirate?"
