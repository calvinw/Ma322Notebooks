## What Are Attribution Models?

Attribution models are methods used in marketing to **assign credit** to the various channels or touchpoints that contribute to a customer's conversion (e.g., making a purchase or signing up for a service). Consider these simple examples:

- **First-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer discovers your brand through an Instagram post and later makes a purchase. In this model, **all credit** is given to that first interactionâ€”even if the customer later visits your website via email or search.
  
- **Last-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer clicks a promotional email and then immediately buys a dress. Here, **all the credit** goes to the email interaction, ignoring any earlier exposures through social media or other channels.

- **Multi-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer sees an influencer post on Instagram, clicks on a retargeting ad, and finally converts after receiving an email about a flash sale. This model distributes the credit **across all channels**, reflecting the reality that each interaction contributed to the final purchase decision.

## How Is This Data Collected?

Before diving into our analysis, it's important to understand how fashion e-commerce companies actually collect this channel exposure data. In our simulation, we'll generate 1s and 0s to represent channel exposure, but in reality, this data comes from multiple tracking systems and tools.

### Channel Tracking Methods

1. **Email Tracking**
   - Records whether a customer was "exposed" (1) through:
     * Email opens (tracked via pixel tracking)
     * Link clicks (tracked via UTM parameters)
     * Conversion from email-specific promo codes
   - A "0" indicates no email interaction was recorded
   - Tools used: Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Bronto
   - Challenges: 
     * Apple's Mail Privacy Protection affecting open rates
     * Multiple email addresses for same customer

2. **Social Media Tracking**
   - Records a "1" when customer:
     * Clicks through from Instagram/Facebook/TikTok posts
     * Uses social-specific promo codes
     * Interacts with shopping tags
   - Tools used: 
     * Facebook Pixel
     * Platform-specific analytics
     * UTM parameters in posts
   - Challenges:
     * Cross-platform customer journeys
     * Attribution windows varying by platform

3. **Paid Search Tracking**
   - Records a "1" for:
     * Clicks on Google/Bing ads
     * Interactions with shopping ads
   - Tools used:
     * Google Ads tracking
     * Microsoft Advertising
     * AdWords conversion tracking
   - Challenges:
     * Keyword attribution
     * Cross-device tracking

4. **Organic Search Tracking**
   - Records a "1" when:
     * Customer arrives via non-paid search results
     * Interacts with Google Shopping free listings
   - Tools used:
     * Google Analytics source/medium tracking
     * Google Search Console
   - Challenges:
     * "Not provided" keywords
     * Distinguishing from direct traffic

5. **Direct Traffic Tracking**
   - Records a "1" for:
     * Direct URL entry
     * Bookmark usage
     * Some app launches
   - Often includes:
     * Influencer campaign traffic
     * Dark social (e.g., messaging apps)
   - Challenges:
     * Attribution accuracy
     * Separating true direct from other sources

### Data Collection Example

Here's how a typical customer journey might be tracked:

```{python}
# Example customer journey data structure
customer_journey = {
    'customer_id': '12345',
    'touchpoints': [
        {
            'channel': 'Instagram',
            'timestamp': '2024-02-01 10:30:00',
            'type': 'post_click',
            'utm_source': 'instagram',
            'utm_medium': 'social',
            'utm_campaign': 'spring_collection'
        },
        {
            'channel': 'Email',
            'timestamp': '2024-02-02 14:20:00',
            'type': 'email_open',
            'campaign_id': 'new_arrival_alert'
        },
        {
            'channel': 'Direct',
            'timestamp': '2024-02-02 14:25:00',
            'type': 'website_visit'
        }
    ],
    'conversion': {
        'occurred': True,
        'timestamp': '2024-02-02 14:40:00',
        'value': 150.00,
        'products': ['dress_123', 'accessory_456']
    }
}
```

The dataset we'll analyze contains 10,000 customer journeys from the Spring/Summer 2024 collection launch, tracking whether customers were exposed to each marketing channel and if they ultimately made a purchase.

## Creating the Dataset

First, let's generate a synthetic dataset that mimics realistic fashion e-commerce conversion rates:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Generate synthetic dataset with 10,000 samples (more realistic sample size)
n_samples = 10000
data = {
    "Email": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.7, 0.3]),  # 30% email exposure
    "Social Media": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.4, 0.6]),  # 60% social media exposure
    "Paid Search": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.8, 0.2]),  # 20% paid search exposure
    "Organic Search": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.7, 0.3]),  # 30% organic search exposure
    "Direct": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.85, 0.15]),  # 15% direct traffic
}

# Set true influence of each channel (coefficients calibrated for ~2% conversion rate)
true_coeffs = np.array([0.5, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4])  # Social Media still has highest impact
intercept = -4.5  # Much lower intercept to achieve realistic conversion rate

# Calculate conversion probabilities
X = np.column_stack([data[key] for key in data])
logits = intercept + np.dot(X, true_coeffs)
probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logits))
conversions = np.random.binomial(1, probabilities)

# Create final DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df["Converted"] = conversions

# Display conversion rate and channel exposure statistics
print("Conversion Rate Analysis:")
conversion_rate = df["Converted"].mean() * 100
print(f"\nOverall conversion rate: {conversion_rate:.2f}%")
print("\nChannel Exposure Rates:")
for channel in data.keys():
    exposed_conv_rate = df[df[channel] == 1]["Converted"].mean() * 100
    exposed_count = df[channel].sum()
    print(f"{channel}:")
    print(f"  - Exposure rate: {exposed_count/n_samples*100:.1f}%")
    print(f"  - Conversion rate when exposed: {exposed_conv_rate:.2f}%")
```

## Logistic Regression Analysis

Now, let's analyze this more realistic dataset using logistic regression to understand the impact of each marketing channel:

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop(columns=["Converted"])
y = df["Converted"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate accuracy
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Get feature coefficients
coefficients = model.coef_[0]
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    "Channel": X.columns,
    "Coefficient": coefficients,
    "Odds Ratio": np.exp(coefficients)
})
feature_importance["Relative Importance (%)"] = (abs(feature_importance["Coefficient"]) / 
                                               abs(feature_importance["Coefficient"]).sum()) * 100
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by="Relative Importance (%)", ascending=False)

# Display detailed results
print("\nChannel Importance Analysis:")
print(feature_importance)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Plot feature importance with fashion-oriented colors
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.barh(feature_importance["Channel"], feature_importance["Relative Importance (%)"], 
         color='plum', edgecolor='purple')
plt.xlabel("Relative Importance (%)")
plt.ylabel("Marketing Channel")
plt.title(f"Marketing Channel Impact on Conversion\nOverall Conversion Rate: {conversion_rate:.2f}%")
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Interpretation of Results for LuxeStyle Boutique

Our analysis of LuxeStyle's marketing data now reflects realistic e-commerce conversion rates and reveals several key insights:

1. **Overall Conversion Rate**: The simulated data shows a conversion rate of approximately 2%, which aligns with typical fashion e-commerce benchmarks. This means that out of every 100 customer journeys, about 2 result in a purchase.

2. **Channel Impact Analysis**:
   - **Social Media Dominance**: Despite the low overall conversion rate, social media shows the strongest relative influence on increasing conversion probability
   - **Email Performance**: Email marketing demonstrates the second-highest impact, particularly effective for retargeting and promotional campaigns
   - **Direct Traffic**: Brand recognition and influencer partnerships show moderate impact
   - **Search Channels**: Both paid and organic search contribute to conversions but with lower relative importance

3. **Channel Exposure Analysis**:
   - Social media has the highest exposure rate (60% of customer journeys)
   - Direct traffic has the lowest exposure rate (15%) but good conversion impact
   - Email reaches 30% of potential customers

### Recommendations for LuxeStyle

Based on these more realistic findings, we recommend:

1. **Social Media Strategy**:
   - Continue strong investment in social media, focusing on conversion optimization
   - Develop more shoppable posts to reduce friction in the purchase journey
   - Test different content types to identify what drives highest conversion rates

2. **Email Marketing Optimization**:
   - Focus on growing the email list given its strong conversion impact
   - Implement abandoned cart and browse recovery emails
   - Test timing and frequency of emails to maximize engagement

3. **Multi-Channel Approach**:
   - While maintaining focus on high-performing channels, keep a balanced presence across all channels
   - Develop channel-specific content strategies
   - Track and optimize cross-channel customer journeys

4. **Conversion Rate Optimization**:
   - Given the realistic 2% conversion rate, focus on both:
     a) Increasing traffic from high-converting channels
     b) Optimizing the conversion funnel to improve rates across all channels

This analysis provides LuxeStyle with actionable insights based on realistic e-commerce metrics, helping them optimize their marketing strategy in the competitive fashion space.
