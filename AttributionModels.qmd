## What Are Attribution Models?

Attribution models are methods used in marketing to **assign credit** to the various channels or touchpoints that contribute to a customer's conversion (e.g., making a purchase or signing up for a service). Consider these simple examples:

- **First-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer discovers your brand through an Instagram post and later makes a purchase. In this model, **all credit** is given to that first interactionâ€”even if the customer later visits your website via email or search.
  
- **Last-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer clicks a promotional email and then immediately buys a dress. Here, **all the credit** goes to the email interaction, ignoring any earlier exposures through social media or other channels.

- **Multi-Touch Attribution:**  
  *Example:* A customer sees an influencer post on Instagram, clicks on a retargeting ad, and finally converts after receiving an email about a flash sale. This model distributes the credit **across all channels**, reflecting the reality that each interaction contributed to the final purchase decision.

## Case Study: LuxeStyle Boutique

Let's examine data from LuxeStyle Boutique, a direct-to-consumer fashion brand that specializes in contemporary women's clothing and accessories. The company has both an online presence and several physical stores, using multiple marketing channels to reach their fashion-forward target audience. They're particularly known for their sustainable practices and size-inclusive collections.

LuxeStyle's marketing mix includes:  

- Email campaigns featuring new collections, styling tips, and exclusive pre-sales
- Strong social media presence on Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok
- Paid search advertising focusing on fashion-related keywords
- Organic search optimization for style guides and trend content
- Direct traffic from brand recognition and offline advertising
- Influencer partnerships (tracked through direct traffic and special URLs)

The dataset we'll analyze contains 1,000 customer journeys from the Spring/Summer 2024 collection launch, tracking whether customers were exposed to each marketing channel and if they ultimately made a purchase.

## Creating the Dataset

First, let's generate a synthetic dataset that mimics LuxeStyle's customer interaction patterns:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Generate synthetic dataset
n_samples = 1000
data = {
    "Email": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.5, 0.5]),  # 50% email exposure (strong email list)
    "Social Media": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.3, 0.7]),  # 70% social media exposure (very strong)
    "Paid Search": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.6, 0.4]),  # 40% paid search exposure
    "Organic Search": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.5, 0.5]),  # 50% organic search exposure
    "Direct": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples, p=[0.7, 0.3]),  # 30% direct traffic
}

# Set true influence of each channel (these coefficients represent the real impact)
# Social media has highest impact for fashion brand
true_coeffs = np.array([1.0, 1.8, 0.8, 0.7, 1.2])  # Social Media has highest impact
intercept = -1.5

# Calculate conversion probabilities
X = np.column_stack([data[key] for key in data])
logits = intercept + np.dot(X, true_coeffs)
probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logits))
conversions = np.random.binomial(1, probabilities)

# Create final DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df["Converted"] = conversions

# Display first few rows and summary statistics
print("First few rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())
print("\nSummary of conversions:")
print(df["Converted"].value_counts(normalize=True))
```

## Logistic Regression Analysis

Now, let's analyze this data using logistic regression to understand the impact of each marketing channel:

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop(columns=["Converted"])
y = df["Converted"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate accuracy
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Get feature coefficients
coefficients = model.coef_[0]
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({"Channel": X.columns, "Coefficient": coefficients})
feature_importance["Relative Importance (%)"] = (abs(feature_importance["Coefficient"]) / abs(feature_importance["Coefficient"]).sum()) * 100
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by="Relative Importance (%)", ascending=False)

# Display results
print("Channel Importance:")
print(feature_importance)

# Plot feature importance with fashion-oriented colors
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.barh(feature_importance["Channel"], feature_importance["Relative Importance (%)"], 
         color='plum', edgecolor='purple')
plt.xlabel("Relative Importance (%)")
plt.ylabel("Marketing Channel")
plt.title(f"Marketing Channel Impact on Conversion (Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f})")
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Interpretation of Results for LuxeStyle Boutique

Our analysis of LuxeStyle's marketing data reveals several key insights relevant to the fashion industry:

1. **Social Media Dominance**: Social media shows the strongest influence on conversions, contributing approximately 32% to conversion likelihood. This aligns with the visual nature of fashion retail and LuxeStyle's strong presence on Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok, where they can showcase their collections through engaging content and influencer partnerships.

2. **Direct Traffic Impact**: With a 25% contribution to conversions, direct traffic is the second most effective channel. This suggests that LuxeStyle's brand recognition and offline marketing efforts (including influencer partnerships) are successfully driving customers directly to their site.

3. **Email Marketing Effectiveness**: Email marketing contributes about 20% to conversion likelihood, showing that LuxeStyle's strategy of sending personalized style recommendations and exclusive pre-sale access to their subscriber base is effective.

4. **Search Channel Performance**: While paid and organic search show lower relative importance, they play crucial roles in capturing customers during specific moments, such as trend-related searches or when looking for specific clothing items.

### Recommendations for LuxeStyle

Based on these findings, we recommend:

1. **Enhance Social Media Strategy**:
   - Increase investment in Instagram and TikTok content creation
